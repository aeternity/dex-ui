            time. A fluctuation of the prices of tokens in the corresponding pair or in the
            liquidity pool is rather possible and can result in significant price slippage. Users
            understand that anybody can create a pair on the DEX and the pairing can be manipulated.
            Users should be cautious when choosing a trading pair and accept the risk of potential

          </li>
          <li>
            Risk of software weaknesses: Users understand and accept that due to the open-source,
            decentralized, public, permissionless concept, the code, the blockchain technology and
            the DEX are in a constant development process. In order to ensure the interaction with
            the DEX, the Website can also undergo further development, amendment or improvement.

            including but not limited to theft or loss of tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risk of mining attacks: Users understand and accept that due to the DEX's blockchain
            based system, it may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to

            resemblance with the original one facilitating the connection to the DEX. As mentioned

            separately as well. Please be careful when accessing and using the DEX and if You use

            formation of a distinct and separate product. Users understand and accept that Æternity
            Establishment cannot avoid the creation of such forks and is not responsible for them.
            Some forks can be harmful. Æternity Establishment shall not be held liable for any
